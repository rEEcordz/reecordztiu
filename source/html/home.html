          (IoT) is the network of physical devices,
          vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics,
          software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these
          objects to connect and exchange data. Each thing is uniquely
          identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to
          inter-operate within the existing Internet infrastructure.
          The figure of online capable devices increased 31% from 2016 to
          8.4 billion in 2017.Experts estimate that the IoT will consist
          of about 30 billion objects by 2020. It is also estimated that the
          global market value of IoT will reach $7.1 trillion by 2020

            The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across
            existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more
            direct integration of the physical world into computer-based
            systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and
            economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention
            When IoT is augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology
            becomes an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems,
            which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, virtual power plants,
            smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities.

            IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation,
            also known as domotics. Large smart home systems utilize a main hub
            or controller to provide users with a central control for all of
            their devices. These devices can include lighting, heating and
            air conditioning, media and security systems. Ease of usability
            is the most immediate benefit to connecting these functionalities.
            Long term benefits can include the ability to create a more
            environmentally friendly home by automating some functions
            such as ensuring lights and electronics are turned off.
            One of the major obstacles to obtaining smart home technology
            is the high initial cost.
