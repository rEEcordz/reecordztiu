        <p>SAVE ENERGY WITH NEST: Nest introduces the 3rd generation Nest Learning Thermostat.
          With four beautiful colors to choose from and an easy to read display,
          this thermostat will help make your home not only smart but energy efficient.
          With just a few manual adjustments, the Nest Thermostat can learn your
          habits and start to save you money by automatically adjusting the temperature.</p>

        <p>DON'T MISS A THING WITH NEST ALERTS: Whether the kids just came home from
          school or the dog has decided to eat those new pillows you just bought; the
          Nest Cam sees it all! Get alerts through your Nest App whenever the camera
          detects movement and activity. And the coolest part is that the Nest Cam can
          tell the difference between movement from say a hand getting into a cookie
          jar, and a person entering a room. Person Alerts and Activity Alerts can
          help keep your home safe even if you aren't there.</p>

        <p>Nest Hello lets you know who’s there, so you never miss a thing. It replaces
          your existing wired doorbell and delivers HD video and bright, crisp images,
          even at night. It’s designed to show you everything at your doorstep – people
          head to toe or packages on the ground. And with 24/7 streaming, you can check
          in anytime. Or go back and look at a 3-hour snapshot history to see what happened.</p>
